Problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].


class Solution {
    int max = 0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        maxDepth(root);
        return max;
    }
    public  int maxDepth(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
        int left = maxDepth(root.left);
        int right = maxDepth(root.right);
        max = Math.max(max, left+right);
    
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
